Adds `runSkillPass(opts)` to `@getmunin/agent-runtime` — a single-shot primitive that opens admin MCP against a Munin instance, reads a `skill://...` resource, and invokes `runAgent` with the skill body as system prompt and a caller-supplied user prompt. Returns `{ ok, toolCalls, totalTokens, finishReason, replyText }` or `{ ok: false, skipped: <reason> }`. Replaces the duplicated curator-pass plumbing that lives in both `munin-cloud/packages/curator-runner/src/scheduled-skill-runner.ts` and the OSS `scripts/curator-runner.mjs` — both can now import this primitive.

Adds `onHandoverResolved` callback to `createRealtimeClient`. Parses `conversation.handover_resolved` events emitted by `conv.service.ts` when a human teammate's reply clears the `needsHumanAttention` flag. Payload: `{ conversationId, messageId, authorType }`. Wired up so the OSS sidecar can run KB curation per-handover (event-driven, scoped to one conversation) instead of waiting for a daily batch sweep.

Updates `skill://kb/curation` to document a per-conversation mode: when the user prompt names a single `conversationId`, the agent skips `conv_list_conversations` and goes straight to that one conversation's (question, human-reply) pair. Batch mode stays the default. Same skill, two invocation patterns — no second skill needed.
