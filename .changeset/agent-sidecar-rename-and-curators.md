Rename `apps/self-service-ai` → `apps/agent-sidecar` (`@getmunin/self-service-ai` → `@getmunin/agent-sidecar`). The package's job has expanded from "self-service AI conversational reply" to "everything an OSS Munin needs as a runtime sidecar": conversations + event-driven KB curation on `conversation.handover_resolved` + scheduled CRM hygiene (weekly) + scheduled CMS stale-content review (monthly).

Adds a persistent `curator_jobs` queue in the backend (new table `curator_jobs`, RLS-isolated, admin-only). The conv service now enqueues a `skill://kb/curation` job at the same point it emits `conversation.handover_resolved`, deduped by message id. The sidecar runs a push-driven worker that claims pending jobs (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`), runs `runSkillPass`, and acks/fails. Failures are retried with exponential backoff (30s, 1m, 2m, 4m, 8m) up to `maxAttempts` (default 5), then marked `dead`. Permanent failures (e.g. `skill_missing`) are reported with `retryable=false` and aren't retried.

Wakeups go through the existing realtime gateway: every enqueue (and every retry-reschedule) emits a `curator_job.pending` event via Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY` → events table → DbListener → websocket → sidecar. Due-now events trigger an immediate claim; future-dated events (retry backoff) schedule a `setTimeout` for the delay. On websocket reconnect, the sidecar fires one drain to catch buffered work. No periodic polling.

The queue gives at-least-once delivery across sidecar restarts and survives transient provider errors. Sidecar offline when the event was emitted? The job sits in `pending`; on reconnect the drain picks it up. Sidecar crashed mid-pass? The lease expires after 10 minutes; the next event triggers a re-claim. Provider returned 502? Failed with retryable=true, re-emitted with the new `nextAttemptAt`, sidecar schedules its own setTimeout to wake at the due time. The weekly KB sweep stays as a belt-and-suspenders measure but the queue is now the durable path.

New REST endpoints (admin-only):
- `POST /api/curator/jobs` — enqueue (used by `conv.service` internally; also available for ad-hoc operator scheduling).
- `POST /api/curator/jobs/claim` — atomic batch claim with lease.
- `POST /api/curator/jobs/:id/ack` — mark done with execution stats.
- `POST /api/curator/jobs/:id/fail` — record error; retryable=true bumps `next_attempt_at`, retryable=false marks `failed`.
- `GET /api/curator/jobs` / `GET /api/curator/jobs/:id` — inspect queue state.

`MuninRestClient` exposes the corresponding methods (`enqueueCuratorJob`, `claimCuratorJobs`, `ackCuratorJob`, `failCuratorJob`).

Sweep cadences moved from the sidecar to the backend via `@nestjs/schedule`. New `CuratorSchedulerService` registers cron jobs for KB sweep (weekly), CRM hygiene (weekly), and CMS stale-content (monthly), each enqueueing a job per org. Sidecar is now purely a queue worker. Benefits: declarative cron expressions instead of `setInterval` ms math, no Node-timer-overflow workaround needed, sweeps fire on cadence even if the sidecar is down (jobs accumulate, drain on next sidecar boot).

New env-var prefix on the sidecar: `MUNIN_SIDECAR_*`. Existing `SELF_SERVICE_AI_*` env vars still work as deprecated aliases — when both are set, `MUNIN_SIDECAR_*` wins. Sidecar curator vars are now just two: `MUNIN_SIDECAR_CURATORS_DISABLED` (worker kill switch) and `MUNIN_SIDECAR_KB_CURATION_ON_HANDOVER` (cosmetic flag — backend always enqueues regardless).

New env-vars on the backend: `MUNIN_CURATOR_KB_SWEEP_CRON`, `MUNIN_CURATOR_CRM_HYGIENE_CRON`, `MUNIN_CURATOR_CMS_STALE_CRON` (standard cron expressions; defaults `0 0 * * 0` weekly Sunday midnight, weekly Sunday midnight, `0 0 1 * *` monthly 1st at midnight). Set any to `off` or `0` to disable that sweep. `MUNIN_CURATOR_SCHEDULER_DISABLED=1` disables the entire scheduler.

Operator review is required for every KB candidate (`kb_publish_curation_candidate`) and every CRM merge proposal (`crm_apply_merge_proposal`) — the sidecar never auto-applies. This is a system invariant: an LLM-drafted doc going straight to the public KB is exactly how you ship hallucinations to your end-users.

Docker compose service renamed `self-service-ai` → `agent-sidecar`. The default MCP `clientName` in `@getmunin/agent-runtime` is now `munin-agent-sidecar` (was `munin-self-service-ai`); call sites that don't pass `clientName` will see this in MCP server logs.

Migration: `0009_curator_jobs` adds the table + indexes. RLS in `rls.sql` blocks end-user contexts from seeing queue rows even within the same org. No data migration needed — the queue starts empty; existing handovers don't backfill.
