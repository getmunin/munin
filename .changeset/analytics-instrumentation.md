Analytics: one row per page view, read depth and route changes tracked by default, canonical subject ids, declarative events, generic search ingest, and identity backfill.

**Breaking for dashboards, not for code: `views` changes meaning.** Until now every page load wrote at least two rows — the initial view plus an exit beacon carrying `dwellMs`, plus one more per SPA route change — so tracker-sourced `views` was inflated roughly 2×. The tracker now mints a `viewId` per page view and sends it on both beacons; ingest upserts on the new partial-unique `(org_id, client_view_id)`, so the exit beacon enriches the row instead of adding one. Tracker `views` drops ~50% on the deploy date; `visitors` is unchanged. History carries no `viewId` and is not repairable, so don't compare `views` across the upgrade. Beacons without a `viewId` still insert one row each — old cached bundles keep working.

Enrichment is max-wins for `dwell_ms` / `read_depth` and fill-if-null for attribution (`referrer`, `utm_*`, `path`, `locale`, `country`, `metadata`, `end_user_id`), so an exit beacon that overtakes the initial view — `sendBeacon` guarantees no ordering — can create the row without erasing the real referrer. `clientViewId` is deliberately absent from `analytics_export_events` / `analytics_import`: it is an ingest dedup key, and merging two servers' events would collide on the index.

**No new flags.** The bundle now measures scroll depth and tracks route changes for every site, and ingest canonicalizes subject ids, all without configuration:

- **Read depth** — passive `scroll` + `resize` listeners, rAF-throttled, deepest 25/50/75/100 milestone, sent on the exit beacon so it costs no extra row. `avgReadDepth` in `analytics_get_subject_engagement` finally has data.
- **Exit reporting on two triggers** — dwell and read depth are sent on `visibilitychange` → hidden as well as `pagehide`. Unload-only beacons are why `dwell_ms` was sparse (mobile app-switch and tab-kill often fire only `visibilitychange`), and reporting twice is free because enrichment is idempotent: same `viewId`, max-wins on both columns. The usual hidden-then-`pagehide` pair sends once; a reader who returns and leaves again reports a larger value.
- **Route changes** — `history.pushState` / `replaceState` / `popstate` close the previous view and open a new one. Changes that leave `location.pathname` alone are ignored, so query-param filter and tab state costs nothing and a classic multi-page site never triggers it.
- **Canonical subject ids** — trailing slashes are always folded (`/pricing/` → `/pricing`), and a leading locale segment is folded when it matches the locale the page itself reports via `<html lang>`, which every beacon already carries (`/en/pricing` on `lang="en-US"` → `/pricing`). The match is exact against the full tag or its language subtag, so `/enterprise/pricing` and `/uk/pricing` on `lang="en-GB"` are untouched, ids that don't start with `/` are never rewritten, and `path` always keeps the raw URL. **Existing localized sites will see subject ids move at the deploy date** — `/en/pricing` events start landing on `/pricing`, so one subject goes quiet and another appears.

`analytics_create_tracker` / `analytics_update_tracker` take `canonicalLocales` for the two cases inference can't reach: pages that set no `lang`, and a URL prefix that disagrees with the tag (`/no/priser` on `lang="nb-NO"`). It applies from the next event with no site redeploy, which is why it lives on the tracker rather than in markup.

Also new:

- `data-mn-event` on any element records a click as a view event, with `data-mn-subject-type`, `data-mn-metadata` (defensively parsed JSON object) and `data-mn-once="session"`. `window.mn.trackOnce()` is the JS twin.
- `POST /v1/a/s` and `window.mn.trackSearch(query, resultCount)` record search events from any search implementation. `analytics_list_zero_result_searches` previously only saw Munin's own CMS delivery search, which left every site running Pagefind/Algolia/a hand-rolled index structurally dark.
- CMS entry views: `_tracking` now ships the bare `token` alongside `pixelUrl`/`beaconUrl`, and the tracker records entry views with a visitor id via `window.mn.trackEntry(token)` or `<div data-mn-entry-token="…">` — on the page that shows the entry, not on list cards, since a `cms_entry` view means "read this" and tagging an index would rank the homepage highest (the skill says so, and names a separate `subjectType` for impressions). The pixel cannot report `visitors` (it takes no visitor parameter, and a first-party cookie can't survive the cross-origin API) — that limitation is now stated in the skill instead of being discovered from `visitors: 0`.

Identity linking backfills: `identify` (and the chat widget's own identity resolution) now stamps `end_user_id` on that visitor's anonymous `analytics_view_events` / `analytics_search_events` rows from the last 30 days, in the same transaction as the bridge row. The auto page view always beats the `identify` round-trip, so without this the first event of every new visitor's session stayed anonymous forever. Adds `analytics_search_events_visitor_idx` to keep that update indexed.
