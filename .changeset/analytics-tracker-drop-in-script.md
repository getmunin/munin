Add a drop-in tracker script for arbitrary web pages — same ergonomics as the chat widget. `analytics_create_tracker` mints a public `mn_track_*` API key, then a single `<script async src=".../v1/a/tracker.js" data-key="mn_track_…">` tag auto-fires page views, tracks dwell on `pagehide`, and exposes `window.mn.track(subjectId, attrs)` for SPA route changes. Events land in `analytics_view_events` with `source='tracker'`. Tracker keys are write-only and org-scoped — safe to embed in browsers.

Also adds three admin read tools: `analytics_top_subjects` (most-viewed pages/entries), `analytics_subject_engagement` (views/dwell/depth for one subject), `analytics_zero_result_searches` (queries readers asked that returned nothing — the best "what to write next" signal). The `cms/review-stale-entries` skill now consults `analytics_subject_engagement` to judge refresh-vs-archive instead of relying on inbound references alone; a new `skill://analytics/track-website-traffic` walks operators through the full setup.
