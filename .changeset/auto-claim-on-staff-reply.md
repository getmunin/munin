Staff messages now atomically take over the conversation.

**Backend** — `ConvService.sendMessage` auto-acquires a `ConversationClaim` whenever a non-internal user-authored message lands. Existing claims by the same user are refreshed; claims held by *other* users no-op rather than throwing — the staff member already replying is implicitly the holder. The handover guard previously rejected any write where `actor.type === 'end_user_agent' || authorType === 'agent'`; that was too broad and blocked the chat-widget surface (which posts as `end_user_agent` on behalf of the end-user). The check is now strictly `authorType === 'agent'`, which is the only write type the claim guard exists to gate.

**Agent runtime** — `shouldRespond` previously deferred whenever any prior `user`-authored message existed in the transcript. That was a coarse stand-in for "is a human handling this?" and it stayed sticky forever. The check now reads the conversation's `claim`: if `claim.holderType === 'user'`, defer until the holder releases (claims have a TTL, so this self-heals).

The combined effect: a human reply takes the conversation, the AI silently steps back, and a "Release" action (or claim TTL expiry) hands it back. End-user follow-ups during the held window still go through, but the AI no longer races the human on the reply.

`ConversationDetail` (returned by `MuninRestClient.getConversation`) gains a `claim: { holderType, holderId, expiresAt } | null` field so any agent-runtime consumer can read the same signal.
