Introduce `@getmunin/docs-pages`: lifts the developer-portal routes (`/docs`, `/docs/rest`, `/docs/mcp`, `/docs/skills`, `/docs/guides`) out of `apps/web` into a shared package so munin-cloud can mount the same docs under its own auth/header chrome. The OSS `apps/web/app/[locale]/docs/*` routes are now thin one-liner shells that re-export from the package.

`@getmunin/backend-core` now publishes the OpenAPI spec and docs fixtures (mcp-tools.json, skills.json) via package subpath exports (`@getmunin/backend-core/openapi.json`, `@getmunin/backend-core/docs-fixtures/*`) so downstream consumers can read them at build time.

Dashboard: removes the CONV pill from the Last conversations rows — the conversation rows in that section are conversations by definition; the pill was redundant.
