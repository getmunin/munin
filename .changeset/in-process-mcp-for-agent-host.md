In-process MCP for the bundled `AgentHostRunner`.

The runner previously POSTed every admin-side MCP call back into its own backend over loopback HTTP, authenticating with a long-lived per-org admin API key. Every layer added for the public edge (host-allowlist, CORS, audience checks, audit) had to grow a loopback escape hatch, and a single stale `MUNIN_KEY_PEPPER` rotation would dead-letter every agent spawn.

This drops the loopback hop. The runner now dispatches admin MCP calls directly into the same handlers the HTTP transport runs.

**`@getmunin/mcp-toolkit`** — factor `createMcpServer`'s per-request handlers into pure `listTools` / `callTool` / `listResources` / `readResource` helpers (new `dispatch.ts`). Both transports now share the exact same scope-check + input-validation + audit logic. Adds `openInProcessMcpClient({ registry, actor, audience, audit, skills? })`.

**`@getmunin/core`** — exports `buildAdminAgentActor(orgId)` for synthesising the agent's `ActorIdentity` (admin audience, `['*']` scopes).

**`@getmunin/backend-core`** — exports `openAgentMcpClient({ db, orgId, registry, skills? })`. Every call self-wraps in a tenancy transaction (same GUCs as `TenancyInterceptor` would set on an HTTP request). Also exports `McpRegistryService` + `McpSkillRegistryService` so external modules (agent-host) can inject the registries.

**`@getmunin/agent-host`** — `AgentHostRunner` uses `openAgentMcpClient` for the admin MCP handle. `AgentHostModule.forRoot(...)` now imports `McpModule` so the registry services resolve. The per-conversation `openMcp({ delegatedToken })` callback inside the chat handler stays on HTTP — that's a real cross-trust boundary (end-user agent calling the backend).

The REST + realtime paths still use the admin API key (deferred to a follow-up). The admin-key encryption columns and `AdminKeyProvider` interface stay.
