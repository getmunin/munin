Add a "Last conversations" section to the dashboard home, below the Usage KPIs. Lists up to 10 conversations from the past 7 days, sorted by most recent message. Each row shows the subject (or `Conversation #displayId` fallback), the last inbound (end-user) message as a muted preview, status badge for non-open states, and a relative timestamp. Click opens the conversation drawer. Hidden when there's nothing in the 7-day window.

Backend: `ConversationSummary` gains an optional `lastInboundPreview` field. `GET /api/v1/conversations` populates it via a correlated subquery over `conv_messages` (latest non-internal `author_type='end_user'` body, collapsed and truncated to 200 chars). Other code paths that build a summary leave the field undefined.

Dashboard: matching styling pass — Queue and Last-conversations headers now use the same ink-black eyebrow + ink underline pattern as Usage; the trailing row border is dropped via `last:border-b-0`. Extracts `useRelative` to `lib/use-relative.ts` so the new section and the existing inbox rows share one source of truth.
