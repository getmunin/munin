MCP dispatch now records redacted `args` on every audit row — including the `denied`, `invalid_input`, `rate_limited`, and thrown-handler paths that previously dropped the args. The success path is unchanged. The `invalid_input` row also now carries the Zod error message in its `error` column instead of just the literal string `"invalid_input"`. Caller-controlled args on `unknown_tool` are still dropped (no schema available to redact against).

A new optional `captureException` hook on `createMcpServer` / `openInProcessMcpClient` receives any error thrown by a tool handler, along with the tool name, actor identity (type / id / orgId), and redacted args. `mcp-toolkit` remains observability-vendor agnostic.

`@getmunin/backend-core` exposes the wiring: a new `ErrorReporterModule` registers a `NoopErrorReporter` against the `ERROR_REPORTER` injection token. `McpController` injects it and forwards thrown handler errors. Hosts that want Sentry (or any other reporter) replace the provider for `ERROR_REPORTER` with their own `ErrorReporter` subclass — `apps/backend` does this with a `SentryErrorReporter` that uses `Sentry.withScope` to attach the tool / actor / args context.

The `cms_upload_asset_from_url` / `cms_upload_asset_from_file` error path now walks the `Error.cause` chain when an outbound fetch fails, so the surfaced message includes the underlying error code (e.g. `ENOTFOUND`, `ECONNRESET`, `CERT_HAS_EXPIRED`) instead of undici's opaque `"fetch failed"`. The unwrapping helper lives in `@getmunin/core` as `describeError(err, maxDepth?)` so other callers of `safeFetch` (and anywhere else cause-chain visibility matters) can reuse it.

`describeError` also replaces three sites that previously surfaced only `err.message`: the webhook delivery worker (`webhook_deliveries.error` — visible to customers via `webhooks_list_deliveries`), `@getmunin/agent-host`'s models fetcher, and `@getmunin/agent-runtime`'s web crawler. Each of those had its own local `describe(err)` helper that did the inferior version.
