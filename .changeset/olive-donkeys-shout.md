Add `outreach_revise_proposal` and `outreach_withdraw_proposal`, the two agent-side corrections to a pending outreach draft.

`outreach_revise_proposal` rewrites the draft in place on the same proposal id — the contact and campaign are fixed, since a different recipient is a different proposal. A `reason` is required and the revision is recorded (`revisionCount`, `lastRevisedAt`, `lastRevisionReason`, revising actor), so an edit can never be silent. Proposals now also record the first time a human opens them for review; when a revision lands after someone else has already read the draft, `revisedAfterReviewAt` is stamped and both the dashboard review drawer and the MCP Apps inspector panel warn the reviewer that Wednesday's text is not the text they read on Monday.

`outreach_withdraw_proposal` lets a curator retract its own pending draft — a duplicate, a prospect who turned out not to qualify, a bounced address — under a new terminal `withdrawn` status. Withdrawal is deliberately neutral: it does not suppress the contact, does not touch consent, and does not stop a campaign sequence, so a withdrawn follow-up leaves that step eligible again where a dismissed one ends the sequence for good. Slack approval cards resolve as withdrawn, and `skill://outreach/review-proposals` documents when each of the four verbs applies.
