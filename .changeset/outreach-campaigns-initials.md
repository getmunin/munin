Outreach feature, PR2 of 3 — campaigns + initial drafts + send-approve loop.

The first user-visible piece of outbound: an operator defines a campaign (name + brief + CRM segment + email channel + cadence + CTA), the new `skill://outreach/draft-initial` curator drafts a personalised first-touch email per consenting contact in the segment, the operator reviews each draft on `/dashboard/review` (third tab), and approving sends via the existing email-channel outbound pipeline. Replies thread into normal conversations via the existing RFC 5322 thread-resolution.

**Schema:**

- `outreach_campaigns` — operator-defined campaigns (segment_id → `crm_segments`, channel_id → `conv_channels` (must be email), brief, cadence_rules JSONB, cta_url, enabled, unsubscribe_required). Unique `(org_id, name)`. RLS admin-only.
- `outreach_proposals` — drafted email queue with `kind` (`initial` in PR2; `reply` in PR3), nullable `conversation_id` (set when sent), `status` lifecycle (pending → sent / dismissed / failed), evidence JSONB, audit fields. **Unique pending index on (campaign_id, contact_id, kind)** to prevent dup drafts. RLS admin-only.
- `conv_conversations` gains `outreach_campaign_id` (nullable FK + index) — sticky once set, used for reply attribution and (in PR3) `agentMode` defaulting.
- New `packages/db/src/sql/outreach.sql` with RLS policies, wired into `runMigrations`.

**Service / MCP / REST** (all in new `@getmunin/backend-core/src/modules/outreach/`):

- `OutreachService` — `listCampaigns`/`getCampaign`/`createCampaign`/`updateCampaign`/`listProposals`/`getProposal`/`proposeInitial`/`approveProposal`/`dismissProposal`. `approveProposal` re-checks suppression+consent at decision-time (the contact may have unsubscribed between draft and approval), creates a conversation with `outreach_campaign_id` set, sends via the existing email outbound pipeline, and appends a signed unsubscribe footer to the body server-side so it can't be tampered with at draft-time.
- MCP tools (admin audience): `outreach_create_campaign`, `outreach_update_campaign`, `outreach_list_campaigns`, `outreach_get_campaign`, `outreach_list_proposals`, `outreach_propose_initial`.
- REST: `GET/POST /api/outreach/campaigns`, `GET/POST /api/outreach/campaigns/:id`, `GET /api/outreach/proposals?status=pending&kind=initial&campaignId=…`, `GET /api/outreach/proposals/:id`, `POST /api/outreach/proposals/:id/approve`, `POST /api/outreach/proposals/:id/dismiss`. The proposals list/get embeds `contact` and `campaign` summaries so the dashboard doesn't need parallel fetches.
- Realtime events: `outreach.proposal.created`, `outreach.proposal.sent`, `outreach.proposal.dismissed` (rides existing WebhookDispatcher).

**Conv-side:** `ConvService.createConversation` now accepts `outreachCampaignId` and enqueues outbound delivery for non-end_user authors on email channels (it previously only did this from `sendMessage`, which broke first-touch sends). All existing flows are unaffected — they don't pass `outreachCampaignId` and their authorType doesn't trigger outbound enqueue.

**Skill:** `skill://outreach/draft-initial` (markdown, copied into dist by the existing `copy-skills.mjs`). Procedure: list enabled campaigns → materialise audience via `crm_list_contacts_in_segment` (which already enforces the suppression+consent floor) → dedupe via `outreach_list_proposals` → ground in `kb_search` → draft 80–200 word personalised email → file via `outreach_propose_initial`. Strict formatting: no headings, plain prose, no JSON-escaping; the unsubscribe footer is appended at approve-time, not draft-time.

**Curator scheduling:**

- New sweep `curator-outreach-draft-initial` (default cron `'0 0 * * 0'` weekly, env `MUNIN_CURATOR_OUTREACH_INITIAL_CRON`).
- Sidecar `toolPrefixesFor` adds `'skill://outreach/draft-initial'` → `['conv_', 'kb_', 'crm_', 'outreach_']`. Cloud `AgentRunnerService.toolPrefixesFor` needs the same one-line addition (separate cloud PR after this OSS release).

**Dashboard:**

- Third tab on `/dashboard/review`: `OutreachDraftsTab` lists pending proposals with markdown body (heading-flatten components shared with KB), Approve / Edit (placeholder; inline editing ships next) / Dismiss buttons. Realtime updates on `outreach.proposal.*` events.
- New `/dashboard/settings/outreach` (under Monitoring → Workspace group) — list campaigns, create dialog with name + brief + segment dropdown + channel dropdown + CTA URL, enable/disable toggle. Empty-state nudges the operator if they have no email channels or segments yet.
- i18n: `dashboard.outreach.*`, `dashboard.outreachDrafts.*`, `nav.outreach`, `dashboard.review.tabs.outreach` in en + nb.

**Tests:** 9 new integration tests covering campaign CRUD (including non-email-channel rejection and duplicate-name conflict), `proposeInitial` (dedupe + consent floor), `approveProposal` (success path stamps conv id + delivery row, suppression-race refuses, disabled-campaign refuses), and `dismissProposal`. Existing 306 backend-core tests unchanged. `curator-scheduler.test.ts` updated to expect the new fourth cron job.

**Out of PR2 scope (lands in PR3):** `agentMode` column + reply-curator skill + draft-on-reply loop. Operators currently get a one-way send; replies land in normal conversations and the AI agent will reply auto-mode by default until PR3 wires `agentMode = 'draft_only'` on outreach-originated conversations.
