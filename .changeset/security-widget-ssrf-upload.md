Security: close widget→admin escalation, SSRF in website-import, upload signing weaknesses, and control-plane authorization gaps.

- Public `mn_widget_*` keys now resolve as a new `widget_agent` actor (not `admin_agent`), with audience forced to `self_service` and scopes narrowed to `conv:widget:write`. New `ControlPlaneGuard` rejects widget/end-user/partner actors and scoped admin keys (must have `*`) on `/v1/*` admin routes, so embedded widget keys can no longer mint, list, or revoke admin API keys, configure channels, or enqueue curator jobs.
- Website-import enqueue and the underlying crawler validate URLs against private/loopback/link-local/cloud-metadata ranges. A new `safeFetch` helper enforces an undici dispatcher that re-validates the resolved IP at connect time (DNS-rebinding-safe) and walks redirects manually.
- Local-storage upload signing switched from plain SHA-256 to HMAC-SHA256; `LocalFsStorage` throws on startup if `MUNIN_STORAGE_LOCAL_SECRET` is missing under `NODE_ENV=production`. Static asset serving sets `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.
- S3 uploads switched from presigned PUT to presigned POST with a `content-length-range` policy condition pinned to the declared size, so an oversized body is rejected by S3 itself. `cms_complete_asset_upload` HEADs the object and rejects (deleting the storage object) on size mismatch. `AssetStorage.presignedUpload` now returns `{ uploadUrl, uploadMethod, uploadFields, … }`; `AssetStorage.statBytes` is now required on the interface.
