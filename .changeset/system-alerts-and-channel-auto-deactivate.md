Introduces `org_alerts`, a first-class operational alerts surface (new `system_alerts_*` MCP tools, `GET /v1/system/alerts`, `org_alert.opened|resolved|acknowledged` realtime events). LLM-provider and channel-inbound failure paths now write to alerts instead of dedicated `last_error` columns on `agent_health` / `conv_inbound_state`, which are dropped. The dashboard banner reads from the alerts feed and renders per-source CTAs.

Auto-deactivates an inbound poll channel after 5 consecutive failures: `conv_channels.active` flips to `false` (so the worker stops hammering broken credentials), the existing alert metadata records `deactivatedAt` + `attemptCount`, and the channels settings page renders an `ACTIVATE` button. `POST /v1/conversations/channels/:id/activate` re-enables the channel and resolves the alert.

Also fixes an `imapflow` crash loop in the email adapter: a late TLS socket error after `tick()` returned was emitted with no listener attached, terminating the Node process. The adapter now attaches an `error` listener at construction and tears down the client on `connect()` failure.
