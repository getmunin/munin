Fix the analytics tracker beacon failing with `ERR_FAILED` / `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` errors in production browsers.

`navigator.sendBeacon` always sends with `credentials: 'include'` (no opt-out), and the previous bundle wrapped its JSON body in a `Blob` with type `application/json`. Since `application/json` is not in the CORS-safelisted Content-Type set, the browser issued a CORS preflight. The beacon endpoint sits under `/v1/a/*`, which `bootstrap-app.ts` treats as a public-CORS path — those echo the request `Origin` but deliberately omit `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` (per CORS spec: wildcard-style origin handling is incompatible with credentials). The preflight therefore failed, and the actual POST never happened. The pixel route (`GET /v1/a/t/:key.gif`) was unaffected because GETs without custom headers don't preflight.

Coupled fix:

- **Bundle (`apps/analytics-tracker/src/tracker.ts`)**: emit the body as `text/plain;charset=UTF-8`. That's CORS-safelisted, so `navigator.sendBeacon` (and the `fetch` no-cors fallback) send the request without a preflight, while cookies still come along — the server doesn't read them anyway.
- **Server (`packages/backend-core/src/bootstrap-app.ts`)**: widen the JSON body parser to also accept `text/plain` bodies. The parser still does `JSON.parse`, so the controller's `@Body() rawBody: unknown` keeps the same shape and the existing Zod schema does the rest. No other endpoints rely on receiving raw `text/plain` today, so the wider type list is a safe extension.

Integration test updated to use `text/plain;charset=UTF-8` so it exercises the production code path; the `beaconDenied` test still uses `application/json` to keep that path covered.
