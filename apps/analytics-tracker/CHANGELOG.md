- 3858d3e: Link analytics tracking to CRM contacts and chat conversations through a shared `end_users` identity.

  Until now the analytics tracker, the chat widget, and the CRM lived in three separate identity silos: `analytics_view_events` carried only an opaque `visitor_id`, while the widget and CRM both spoke `end_users.id`. A visitor's page-view history stayed orphaned even when they later identified themselves in chat or signed in.

  This change introduces an `analytics_visitor_identities` bridge table mapping `(org_id, visitor_id) → end_user_id`, and a denormalised `end_user_id` column on both event tables that the analytics service stamps at ingest time. Two write paths populate the bridge:
  - **Widget**: `findOrCreateEndUser` in `widget-ingest.service.ts` now upserts the bridge whenever a chat session carries a `visitorId`. The chat widget and the analytics tracker now share the same `localStorage` key (`mn.vid`), so a visitor who first opens the widget retroactively links their already-stored tracker visitor id.
  - **Tracker**: new `POST /v1/a/identify` endpoint plus a `window.mn.identify(externalId, userHash)` method on the tracker bundle. Identity is verified by HMAC against a per-tracker secret; mint one via `analytics_create_tracker` (returned once) or rotate with the new `analytics_rotate_tracker_identity_secret` tool. Tampered hashes are rejected silently.

  Query tools now accept an optional `endUserId` / `contactId` filter (`analytics_views_over_time`, `analytics_subject_engagement`, `analytics_top_subjects`), and a new `analytics_contact_journey` tool returns the chronological page-view + search timeline for a known visitor. Past anonymous rows stay orphaned — there is no retroactive backfill.

  The dashboard gains a **Settings → Analytics trackers** page that lists trackers, mints new ones (with the public key + identity secret revealed once), shows whether identity verification is configured, and lets admins rotate the identity secret or revoke the tracker without dropping to MCP tools.

  The tracker bundle gains a script-tag identity path (`data-external-id` + `data-user-hash`), matching the chat widget's embed shape. The runtime `window.mn.identify()` call remains as the SPA escape hatch.

  The chat widget gets a matching runtime identity path: `window.munin.identify(externalId, userHash)` posts to a new `POST /v1/widget/identify` endpoint. When an anonymous chat session identifies mid-flight, the backend migrates the conversation: the verified `end_users` row replaces the `anon:…` one, the contact's `metadata.externalId` is updated, and the analytics bridge is rewritten — so the same browser's prior page-views attach to the now-known visitor without losing the chat history.

### Patch Changes

- 15d6ed4: When `localStorage` throws (private windows, embedded WebViews, locked-down enterprise browsers, storage quota), the tracker bundle now generates a page-scoped UUID as the visitor id instead of sending `null`. Previously every pageview from a storage-disabled session read as a new visitor, so unique-visitor counts and within-session dedup were broken for that traffic — and SPA route changes from one user looked like N separate visitors.

  The fallback id only survives the page lifetime (no persistent storage to fall back on), so the same user reloading the page still gets counted twice. That's the inherent cost of having no storage; this fix just keeps at least intra-session dedup working. Privacy story is unchanged — the id is a random UUID, never linked to PII.

### Patch Changes

- 1fe3019: Fix the analytics tracker beacon failing with `ERR_FAILED` / `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` errors in production browsers.

  `navigator.sendBeacon` always sends with `credentials: 'include'` (no opt-out), and the previous bundle wrapped its JSON body in a `Blob` with type `application/json`. Since `application/json` is not in the CORS-safelisted Content-Type set, the browser issued a CORS preflight. The beacon endpoint sits under `/v1/a/*`, which `bootstrap-app.ts` treats as a public-CORS path — those echo the request `Origin` but deliberately omit `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` (per CORS spec: wildcard-style origin handling is incompatible with credentials). The preflight therefore failed, and the actual POST never happened. The pixel route (`GET /v1/a/t/:key.gif`) was unaffected because GETs without custom headers don't preflight.

  Coupled fix:
  - **Bundle (`apps/analytics-tracker/src/tracker.ts`)**: emit the body as `text/plain;charset=UTF-8`. That's CORS-safelisted, so `navigator.sendBeacon` (and the `fetch` no-cors fallback) send the request without a preflight, while cookies still come along — the server doesn't read them anyway.
  - **Server (`packages/backend-core/src/bootstrap-app.ts`)**: widen the JSON body parser to also accept `text/plain` bodies. The parser still does `JSON.parse`, so the controller's `@Body() rawBody: unknown` keeps the same shape and the existing Zod schema does the rest. No other endpoints rely on receiving raw `text/plain` today, so the wider type list is a safe extension.

  Integration test updated to use `text/plain;charset=UTF-8` so it exercises the production code path; the `beaconDenied` test still uses `application/json` to keep that path covered.

### Patch Changes

- 38e00cd: Tidy up the changesets configuration to cover every workspace package:
  - Add `@getmunin/analytics-tracker` to the `fixed` group so it bumps in lockstep with the rest of the publishable `@getmunin/*` suite. The package was introduced at `4.33.0` and never re-versioned, leaving downstream consumers unable to pin `^4.x` against the same range as `@getmunin/backend-core`. `apps/analytics-tracker/package.json` is manually aligned to `4.40.1` so this release moves the group together.
  - Add `@getmunin/widget-voice` to the `ignore` list. It's `private: true` and already excluded from publishing, but every other private package in the workspace is explicitly ignored — adding it here keeps the config consistent and prevents accidental version-bump noise.
