### Patch Changes

- 0814264: Move `@getmunin/widget-voice` from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`. Vite already inlines it into the IIFE bundle at build time (`inlineDynamicImports: true`), so consumers should not try to resolve it at install time. As shipped in 4.19.2 the published package errored on `pnpm install` because `widget-voice` is a private workspace package not available on the registry.

## 4.19.2

### Patch Changes

- 0ea9b12: Publish `@getmunin/chat-widget` to GitHub Packages so the cloud backend image can install the prebuilt widget bundle from the registry instead of needing a workspace link. Aligns its version with the rest of the public OSS packages and adds it to the changesets `fixed` group so future releases keep all OSS package versions in lockstep.
