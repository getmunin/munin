## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- fe8fd21: TenancyInterceptor: bypass RLS for `actor.type === 'partner'`.

  Partner actors (cloud-only) operate across multiple orgs they
  provisioned. Their controllers filter manually by `partner_id`. OSS
  never produces `'partner'` actors, so this branch is dead code there.

- Updated dependencies [fe8fd21]
  - @getmunin/core@0.3.1
  - @getmunin/db@0.3.1
  - @getmunin/types@0.3.1

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5c140d5: Add credential-resolver extension point to AuthGuard.

  `AuthGuard` now accepts an optional injected `AdditionalCredentialResolver[]`
  via the `ADDITIONAL_CREDENTIAL_RESOLVERS` token. When OSS's `resolveApiKey`
  returns null, each additional resolver gets a shot at the raw key. Cloud
  (`@munin-cloud/partner`) plugs in `PartnerCredentialResolver` here to
  recognize `mn_part_*` keys without touching OSS code.

  `looksLikeApiKey` regex broadened from `mn_(admin|dlg)_*` to `mn_[a-z]+_*`
  so non-OSS kinds (like `mn_part_*`) reach the resolver chain.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f3abef4: Add cross-org switcher endpoint + UI.
  - New `GET /api/orgs/me/memberships` — list every org the caller is a member of (id, name, slug, role, isDefault).
  - New `PATCH /api/orgs/me/memberships/active` — flip `is_default` so the next session-cookie request resolves to the chosen org.
  - New `<OrgSwitcher />` component in `@getmunin/dashboard-pages` that wraps both endpoints. Cloud's dashboard layout renders it in the header.

  OSS (single-tenant) installs see exactly one membership and don't render a switcher.
