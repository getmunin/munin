### Minor Changes

- 6506b10: Channel-adapter contract + chat-widget adapter.

  Generalizes the conversation channel runtime: a single `ChannelAdapter`
  interface (poll / webhook / push inbound modes), generic `InboundPollWorker`
  and `OutboundDeliveryWorker` that dispatch by `conv_channels.type`, and a
  `POST /api/channels/:id/webhook` scaffold for future webhook-mode adapters
  (SMS, voice). Email is refactored behind the new contract — no behavior
  change; the existing email integration test passes unchanged.

  New chat-widget channel kind for external AI agents (chat widgets on
  customer sites) to push transcripts into Munin's `conv_*` tables. Includes:
  - `mn_widget_*` API key kind, channel-bound via new nullable
    `api_keys.channel_id` column.
  - `POST /api/conv/widget/messages` — public ingest endpoint authenticated
    by the widget key. Idempotent on `metadata.providerMessageId`; conv
    upsert by `metadata.sessionId`.
  - MCP admin tools: `conv_widget_create_channel`, `conv_widget_rotate_key`,
    `conv_widget_update_channel`.

  Schema changes:
  - New `conv_inbound_state(channel_id, cursor jsonb, ...)` replaces the
    email-only `conv_email_inbound_state`. Existing rows backfilled.
  - `api_keys.channel_id` (nullable, FK to `conv_channels`).
  - Two partial unique expression indexes for widget idempotency.

  The email worker env vars `MUNIN_EMAIL_INBOUND_WORKER_DISABLED` and
  `MUNIN_EMAIL_OUTBOUND_WORKER_DISABLED` are still honored as aliases of
  `MUNIN_INBOUND_POLL_WORKER_DISABLED` and `MUNIN_OUTBOUND_DELIVERY_WORKER_DISABLED`.

### Patch Changes

- fe8fd21: TenancyInterceptor: bypass RLS for `actor.type === 'partner'`.

  Partner actors (cloud-only) operate across multiple orgs they
  provisioned. Their controllers filter manually by `partner_id`. OSS
  never produces `'partner'` actors, so this branch is dead code there.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5c140d5: Add credential-resolver extension point to AuthGuard.

  `AuthGuard` now accepts an optional injected `AdditionalCredentialResolver[]`
  via the `ADDITIONAL_CREDENTIAL_RESOLVERS` token. When OSS's `resolveApiKey`
  returns null, each additional resolver gets a shot at the raw key. Cloud
  (`@munin-cloud/partner`) plugs in `PartnerCredentialResolver` here to
  recognize `mn_part_*` keys without touching OSS code.

  `looksLikeApiKey` regex broadened from `mn_(admin|dlg)_*` to `mn_[a-z]+_*`
  so non-OSS kinds (like `mn_part_*`) reach the resolver chain.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f3abef4: Add cross-org switcher endpoint + UI.
  - New `GET /api/orgs/me/memberships` — list every org the caller is a member of (id, name, slug, role, isDefault).
  - New `PATCH /api/orgs/me/memberships/active` — flip `is_default` so the next session-cookie request resolves to the chosen org.
  - New `<OrgSwitcher />` component in `@getmunin/dashboard-pages` that wraps both endpoints. Cloud's dashboard layout renders it in the header.

  OSS (single-tenant) installs see exactly one membership and don't render a switcher.
